##Artifact Overview
This artifact is a C++ client management program that I worked on during my last term in the CS 410 Reverse Engineering course. It was created as part of my final assignment. The main goal of the project was to review the code for security issues, explain why they were problems, and fix them. The original version only focused on the main() function, but the full code had other parts that needed improvement too.

##Reason for Selection
I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it shows my ability to find and fix problems in existing code. This project gave me the chance to work with C++ and focus on secure coding, input validation, and overall code quality. I picked it because I had already worked on the main function in my CS 410 class, but I knew the rest of the code still needed work. This made it a good choice for showing how I could take a project further. I improved the artifact by fixing security issues, adding better input checks, handling errors, and making the code easier to read. I also made sure each function had a clear purpose and added comments so anyone reading the code could understand it. These updates reflect my skills in software design and following best practices.

##Course Outcomes Alignment
This enhancement demonstrated key skills in software development and secure coding. I applied techniques to identify vulnerabilities, improve program structure, and increase code readability. These changes show my ability to design and improve solutions using industry best practices, which aligns with professional goals in software engineering. I also improved error handling and usability by making the program more reliable and easier to maintain. This project helped reinforce my ability to troubleshoot, refactor code, and implement meaningful changes that reflect a security-first mindset.

##Enhancement Reflection
While enhancing and updating the code, I learned how small changes can make a big difference in making a program more secure and easier to use. I paid closer attention to how input is handled, how clear the output is, and how each function works together. I also learned the importance of writing code that others can understand by adding comments and cleaning things up. One of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to improve areas of the code that were left unfinished or didnâ€™t really do anything yet. It took some time to decide what to change and how to keep it working without adding too much. Overall, this helped me get better at reading and improving code, not just writing it from scratch.
