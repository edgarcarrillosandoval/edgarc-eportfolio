### Artifact Overview
This artifact is a C++ project I created during the CS 405 Secure Coding course. The project focused on stopping SQL injection attacks by making the programâ€™s database interactions more secure. It used an SQLite database and allowed user input to run queries, but the original version was vulnerable to attacks like 'OR value=value'. I worked on fixing that issue by improving how the program handled input and database queries. I added code to detect risky input, block unsafe queries, and later updated it again to use safer query methods. The project helped me understand how attackers take advantage of bad query structure and why secure coding matters. It was first created during my earlier term, and Iâ€™ve now enhanced it further for this course.

### Reason for Selection
I chose this project for my ePortfolio because it shows that I understand how to fix real security problems in code. The original assignment already gave me a good start, but I knew I could make it better. It was a good example of working with databases in C++, and I was able to improve how the program handles user input and protects against SQL injection. I also added stronger input checks, used parameterized queries to make the database safer, and created a simple logging system to track risky activity. These updates show my skills in writing safer, cleaner code and thinking about how someone could try to break the system. It also gave me a chance to learn more about how real database attacks happen and how to stop them. This artifact now shows both my coding abilities and my growth in secure software development.

### Course Outcomes Alignment
For this enhancement, I originally planned to meet two specific outcomes: using secure coding techniques and tools to solve industry-level problems and developing a security mindset that helps prevent vulnerabilities in software. These goals were met by replacing raw SQL queries with parameterized statements, validating user input to avoid dangerous patterns, and adding logging to track suspicious activity. Each of these changes helped strengthen the programâ€™s security and made the database interactions more reliable. In the process, I also demonstrated additional course outcomes. By writing clear code with helpful comments, I supported the ability to communicate technical work in a way others can understand. I also showed that I could design and improve a working solution by applying algorithmic thinking and managing trade-offs like balancing stronger security without over-complicating the logic. These updates show progress in four total outcomes, not just the original two, and support my growth in both security practices and real-world development.

### Enhancement Reflection
While working on this enhancement, I learned how important it is to secure database queries and handle input carefully. I understood SQL injection better by seeing how unsafe queries could be exploited and how parameterized statements can stop those attacks. Adding stronger input checks and logging also helped me see how these features work together to protect the system. These updates not only improved the programâ€™s security but also made it more stable and reliable. One of the challenges I ran into was getting familiar with new SQLite functions like prepared statements and making sure they worked the way I expected. I had to test different inputs and review the output closely to confirm everything was working right. I also had to be careful with how the input was filtered so valid queries still worked while suspicious ones were blocked. Overall, the process helped me grow as a developer and gave me more confidence in writing secure code.
