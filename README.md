Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio helped me reflect on how much Iâ€™ve grown technically and professionally. Throughout the program, I worked on real code, solved security problems, and improved my ability to explain how and why code works. The ePortfolio gave me the chance to take some of my best projects and strengthen them even more. It helped me highlight my skills in debugging, secure coding, algorithms, working with databases, and handling real hardware setups. These are all things I can now confidently speak about in a professional setting, whether Iâ€™m applying for software engineering jobs or trying to break into product management.

A few key projects really shaped my experience. In CS 410 Reverse Engineering, I took a client management program written in C++ and improved it by fixing broken logic, adding input validation, and simplifying the flow of the main function. That helped me improve my skills in analyzing and reworking existing codeâ€”something thatâ€™s very important in the real world. In CS 405 Secure Coding, I worked on a C++ program connected to an SQLite database that was vulnerable to SQL injection. I replaced risky query patterns with parameterized queries, added input validation, and built a logging system to track suspicious activity. These changes showed my understanding of how to build safer, more reliable software.

In CS 465 Full Stack Development, I created a RESTful API using Node.js and MongoDB, and connected it to a front-end Angular application. I added secure login, protected routes, and user-friendly features like filtering and sorting. That project helped me learn how front-end and back-end systems work together and how important it is to think about user experience. I also got used to testing and debugging in a full-stack environment. Most recently, in CS 350 Emerging Technology, I built hardware projects using a Raspberry Pi. I wired sensors and LEDs to a breadboard, wrote Python scripts to control components, and even used UART communication to send data from the Pi to a terminal. These hands-on labs showed me how software and hardware connect and gave me confidence working with embedded systems.

Working on these projects helped me develop important technical skills, but I also improved in other areas. I learned how to explain my work clearly through comments, presentations, and written narratives. I worked on coding teams in earlier classes and learned to ask good questions, give feedback, and follow best practices when collaborating. I also got better at thinking through the trade-offs in designâ€”like keeping things simple and readable vs. making them faster or more secure.

The three artifacts I included in my portfolio, each enhanced in software design, algorithms, and databases, fit together to show a well-rounded view of my abilities. One shows my skill in fixing and refactoring broken code. Another highlights my understanding of security and database protection. The last one demonstrates how I approach algorithmic thinking and memory usage. Together, they show that I know how to work through problems, improve existing systems, and build new ones that are secure and efficient.

This ePortfolio is more than just a collection of files. It tells the story of what Iâ€™ve learned and what I can offer as a developer. These enhancements prove I can solve real problems, think through solutions, and back up my ideas with working code.
